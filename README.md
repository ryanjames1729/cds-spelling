## Getting Started

This is a spelling app designed for children ages 6-12. I designed this app for teachers and students to use at the school I work at, Carolina Day School. Teachers can sign in with their Google SSO and create word lists. It creates a new slug for each quiz that can be shared with students. The app will speak the words from the word list and allow them to try to type the right spelling of the word into the app.

## Live Version

The live version for this app lives at [CDS Spells!](https://cds-spelling.netlify.app/)

## What's In This Project

I used [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), [nextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/), [react-speech-kit](https://github.com/MikeyParton/react-speech-kit), and [Hygraph](https://hygraph.com) to put this project together. It is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
